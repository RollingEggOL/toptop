The following demos are designed to be run non-interactively, though they can also be loaded into the modeling program and interactively manipulated.  The general format used is to provide a pair of files

* demo_name.0.off    (initial mesh position)
* demo_name.1.off    (final mesh position)

These pairs can be input to the $TOPTOP_ROOT/bin/edit program using the following sub-commands:

bin/edit X.0.off -rawparity X.1.off

    Compute raw parity field by running collision detection

bin/edit X.0.off -parity X.1.off

    Compute smoothed/error corrected parity field

bin/edit X.0.off -topo X.1.off

    Compute complete result of topology change, including deletion of unwanted triangles.

Additionally, the following two commands can be used to look at the intermediate results of intersection computation on the final mesh

bin/edit X.1.off -showisct

    Show the intersection points and curves computed

bin/edit X.1.off -resolveisct

    Show the mesh resulting from subdividing and gluing along those intersections identified by -showisct
